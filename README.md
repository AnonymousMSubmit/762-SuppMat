## Introduction
We propose a novel safety-guided ADS testing framework, named DrTest, by proposing new approaches to exploit the Forestalling Scenario from disengagement reports. Specifically, by cross-analyzing the reports, driving specifications, and implementations of ADS, DrTest can convert the information from reports into specific driving events, which can assist in constructing the test scenarios of collisions, law-violations, and mission-failures for autonomous vehicles (AVes).   
Furthermore, DrTest analyzes the variable features of each scenario and mutates the scenarios using the evolution algorithm to generate safety test cases under different driving conditions.   
The project will be available after our paper is accepted.
